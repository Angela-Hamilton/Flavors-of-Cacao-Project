# Flavors-of-Cacao-Project
Exploratory Analysis of an open-sourced data set with different cocoa flavors of over 1,700 chocolate bars from 2006 – 2017.

# Objective
Analyze open-sourced data to identify connections between variables and conduct advanced analytical approaches to test hypotheses.

# Data Sourcing:
This is an external data source from Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google. The data source is an online platform for data 
scientists and machine learning enthusiasts, which provides a wide collection of datasets that are available to the public.

# Data Collection:
Open-Source data that is free and available to the public. Since this dataset is considered open data that is collected 
by third-party sources, there could be bias in the data collection. The last update for this dataset was back in 2017, which causes there 
to be a time lag.

# Data Content:
The data contains expert ratings for the different flavors of cocoa of over 1,700 chocolate bars from 2006 – 2017. The data consists of 
nine columns categorized by cocoa bean types for various regions and contains cocoa bean origins, flavor ratings, manufacturers name, 
reference numbers, % of cocoa, and the year of the review

# Key Questions that my exploratory analysis should answer:
* What countries produce the highest rated chocolate bars?
* Where are the best cocoa beans grown? Specifically, do chocolate bars with the highest % of cocoa have the highest 
ratings?
* What are the top five companies that have the highest expert ratings?
* What are the top five countries with the highest ratings?

# Data Cleaning Procedure(s)
* Renamed Column Names for consistency across column headings
* Changed Data types
* I did not address missing values for bean_type, and bean_origin
